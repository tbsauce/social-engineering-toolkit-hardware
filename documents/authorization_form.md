### 1. Purpose and Objectives  
This document formally requests authorization to conduct a Security Awareness Assessment at the University of Aveiro. The primary objectives of this assessment are:
- Evaluate employee awareness of security risks and adherence to institutional protocols. 
- Identify vulnerabilities in human factors through controlled social engineering techniques. 
- Strengthen organizational resilience against real-world threats while maintaining full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and established ethical standards.  

This security assessment will be carried out under the direct supervision of the Director of the Cybersecurity Office. The collected data and findings will serve to enhance the University's security awareness programs through evidence-based improvements, and to support academic research for a thesis on cybersecurity. All testing procedures and data handling will strictly adhere to the University's mission of promoting cybersecurity awareness and maintaining institutional data protection standards.

### 2. Scope and Methodology  

#### 2.1 Target Areas and Duration  
The assessment will be conducted exclusively within the University of Aveiro campus, with priority given to high-traffic user zones and areas accessible to privileged personnel. The proposed timeline for this engagement commences on  [Start Date] and concluding on [End Date].  

#### 2.2 Testing Protocols  
Authorized testing techniques will include phishing, deauthentication, evil twin, rogue router, keystroke, keylogging, and RFID attacks. These methods will be implemented with strict limitations: no exploitation of systems beyond initial access demonstration, no collection or storage of personal data as defined under GDPR Article 4, and immediate termination of any engagement upon participant identification as a "victim."  

#### 2.3 Data Handling  
Collection will be limited to aggregate metrics such as success rates of interactions. All results will be anonymized and retained solely for academic purposes in accordance with the University's research data policy.

### 3. Legal and Ethical Compliance  

#### 3.1 GDPR Compliance Framework  
This security awareness assessment is conducted in full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), with all personal data processing, where applicable, being carried out under the legitimate interests pursued by the University of Aveiro to enhance institutional cybersecurity and mitigate risks to data subjects, as permitted under Article 6. A documented balancing test ensures these interests do not override individuals' fundamental rights and freedoms. 

The assessment adheres strictly to the principles of purpose limitation, processing only anonymized or pseudonymized data necessary for evaluating security awareness, and maintains transparency by providing participants with post-assessment debriefings regarding scope, outcomes, and data usage in accordance with Articles 13â€“14. The assessment explicitly excludes any form of automated decision-making, profiling, or systematic monitoring of individuals to ensure alignment with ethical and legal standards.

#### 3.2 Roles and Accountability  
As the data controller, the University retains accountability for all processing activities per Articles 4(7), 24, and 28. Any third-party processors will be bound by contractual agreements specifying processing duration, nature, purpose, data categories, and obligations to comply with GDPR protections.  

In the event of a personal data breach, testers must immediately notify the University's DPO. The University will report qualifying breaches to supervisory authorities within 72 hours as required by Article 33(1), including details of the breach's nature, affected data categories, and approximate record counts per Article 33(3). Data subjects will be notified without undue delay when breaches pose high risk to their rights, unless mitigating measures render the data unintelligible.  

#### 3.3 Ethical Safeguards  
The assessment incorporates multiple ethical safeguards. No personal data will be retained beyond immediate testing needs, with only anonymized aggregate metrics recorded. All engagements with participants will cease immediately upon identification as a "victim" to prevent unnecessary exposure.

### 4. Attachments and Supporting Documents  

- **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA):** This binding agreement ensures confidentiality of all assessment activities and findings, prohibiting disclosure of sensitive information with enforceable penalties for breaches.  

- **Emergency Contact:** Provides immediate contact information for the DPO and Cybersecurity Director to facilitate verification and incident response during testing operations.  

- **Attack Plan:** Outlines approved social engineering methodologies, including specific objectives and their potential impact on target organizations.

- **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA):** Identifies and evaluates risks to personal data before processing begins, ensuring compliance and minimizing harm to data subjects.

### 5. Next Steps  

Following authorization, the assessment should proceed through four phases: 
- A comprehensive review of assessment data to identify key vulnerability patterns. 
- Design of targeted Awareness Programs addressing identified weaknesses. 
- Rollout of awareness campaigns through workshops, e-learning modules, and periodic simulated attacks. 
- Scheduling of follow-up assessments to measure program effectiveness, with training materials adjusted based on new threat intelligence and employee feedback.
